Kubeflow is a powerful tool designed to simplify and streamline machine learning operations (MLOps) on Kubernetes.

# Why Kubeflow
## Scalability
Kubeflow runs on Kubernetes, leveraging its ability to scale computational resources up and down as needed. This allows for efficient handling of large datasets and complex models. Plus, Kubeflow supports distributed training of machine learning models, making it easier to train large models on clusters of machines.

## Portability
Kubeflow is designed to be platform-agnostic (i.e. cross platform), meaning it can run on any cloud provider that supports Kubernetes (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) as well as on-premises clusters. 

## Automation
Kubeflow supports scheduling of pipeline runs, allowing for automatic retraining and evaluation of models at regular intervals. Also, built-in support for hyperparameter tuning with tools like Katib helps automate the optimization of model parameters.
